Starting 2016 set.
Count of rows: 31,461.
Creating clean_stavbe_2016 where we filter data by obcina, 
purpuse of the building - living quarters, 
what kind of living quarters: 1 = house, 2 = apartments

our usual code: 
SELECT *
  FROM gurs.main.stavbe_2015
 WHERE OBCINA = 'LJUBLJANA'
   AND VRSTA_DELA_STAVBE = 1
   AND DEJANSKA_RABA_DELA_STAVBE LIKE '%Stanovanje%';
   didn't include apartments, which I just noticed.
= 455 entires
Fixed code:
SELECT *
  FROM gurs.main.stavbe_2015
 WHERE OBCINA = 'LJUBLJANA'
   AND (VRSTA_DELA_STAVBE = 1 OR VRSTA_DELA_STAVBE = 2)
   AND DEJANSKA_RABA_DELA_STAVBE LIKE '%Stanovanje%';

= 3423 hits

in gurs report we have 2950 sold apartments and 400 houses.
sum = 3350 of sold real estate.

deleting all of the entries that have a NULL in size
= 3421 matches

after deleting all the entries, that have multiple ID_POSLA
we are left with: 3153
