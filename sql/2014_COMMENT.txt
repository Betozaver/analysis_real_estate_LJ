For a year 2014, Ljubljana area, real estate was deeply effected
by new development located in Poljane, Poljanski nasip. 
There were 324 deals made under the same ID_POSLA. So, there were 324 apartments sold.
But there is a hiccup. In other file, where there are final offers and for how much each
ID_POSLA was sold, there is only one number: 195k. Is that per appartment= no way, that
all were priced same. In file with buildings, we can clearly see, that apartments were different
sizes and also there should be different prices.
It looks like, that they have sold the whole apartment building or two, but GURS somehow
kept all of the dealings under the same ID_POSLA and have not disclosed the REAL amount.
We should've had 324 entries, for each apartment unit, but we only have one.
Solution that I was thinking about is, to cut 324 apartments, since it would skew my data, 
and absolutely destroy ML process. 
For year 2014, in Ljubljana area, there were sold 871 apartments and houses.
Looking at yearly report from GURS, 

ID_POSLA -678772 = prodanih 324 stanovanj, cena se na ujema na poslih. Navedeno 195k
ID_POSLA -673,636 = prodanih 11 stanovanj, cena se ne ujema na poslih. navedeno 180k
ID_POSLA -673160 = je prodanih 11 stanovanj, cena se ne ujema. navedenih 110k
ID_POSLA -673165 = je prodana stanovanjska hiša, 9 stanovanj. Ne ujema. 170k
ID_POSLA -673165 = je prodana stanovanjska hiša, 6 stanovanj. ne ujema. 95k

I had to erase all the multiple entries of ID_POSLA, since none of there
entries had apartment size entred.
Also, had to erase some of the multiple entris of ID_POSLA, with the 
entred size, due to the fact, that it was not specified in other file, 
for wihich of those two or three entries the price is appliable.

We were left with 435 apartments/houses out of 871. which is with 50% of
data provided.
