For a year 2014, Ljubljana area, real estate was deeply effected
by new development located in Poljane, Poljanski nasip. 
There were 324 deals made under the same ID_POSLA. So, there were 324 apartments sold.
But there is a hiccup. In other file, where there are final offers and for how much each
ID_POSLA was sold, there is only one number: 195k. Is that per appartment= no way, that
all were priced same
